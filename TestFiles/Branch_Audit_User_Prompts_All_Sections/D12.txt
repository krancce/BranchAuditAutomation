standard_name: D12: Filing Drawer Organization Guidelines

definition: |
  Evaluates the organization and labeling of hanging file drawers for easy retrieval and orderly appearance.

requirements_checklist:
- Hanging files are arranged in a generally tidy and accessible manner. Minor variations in spacing or alignment are acceptable as long as they don’t obstruct usability.
- Clear, descriptive labels on at least one file tab per section are preferred but not mandatory, as long as some visible grouping or organization is apparent.
- Drawer interior should not contain excessive debris or unrelated clutter. A few loose papers are acceptable if the overall drawer appears clean, tidy, and usable.

notes: |
  Do not penalize for isolated loose papers or minor labeling inconsistencies as long as the drawer appears functionally organized and tidy.
  Some drawers may follow non-uniform organization styles—this is acceptable if usability is preserved.
  Emphasize general tidiness, functional order, and accessibility over strict folder-by-folder consistency.
