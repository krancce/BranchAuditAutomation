standard_name: A1: Road Signs / Lawn Signs / A-Frames

requirements_checklist:
- All signs are upright (not leaning or fallen).
- All signs are clean (no visible dirt, stains, or damage).
- No expired promotions visible.
- No signs blocking walkways.
- Lighting works at dusk (if applicable).

clarification_notes: |
  - If the store provides a justification comment explaining that there is no road sign, lawn sign, or A-frame (for example: "store does not have a road sign" or "no sign at this location"), and this explanation is plausible, then PASS this section. Clearly state in notes: "Conditional pass: Store explained reason as follows: [repeat justification]."
  - Do not fail for the absence of signage when a valid store justification is given. Only fail if the justification is missing or implausible, or if the section fails other requirements and no comment is given.
  - If in doubt, pass.
