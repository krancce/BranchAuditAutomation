requirements_checklist:
 - Microwave and fridge interiors should appear clean and hygienic. Some minor discoloration or stains from long-term use is acceptable as long as no food residue or debris is present.

 - No food particles, spills, or leftover items visible inside appliances or on surfaces.

Note: Focus on hygiene and usability. Do not penalize minor, unremovable discoloration or staining if the appliance is otherwise clean and ready for use.
