standard_name: E1: Posted Cleaning & Daily Log

requirements_checklist:
- Cleaning schedule or log sheet is clearly posted and fully visible.
- Sign-offs are present for the majority of required dates:
  • It’s fine if weekend or holiday fields are blank or unsigned.  
  • Only flag if multiple consecutive regular weekdays are missing signatures.  
- The sheet is legible, undamaged, and free of tears or watermarks that obscure entries.
- No unrelated papers or notices are taped over the schedule.
- The area around the log remains tidy (no loose sheets or debris covering the schedule).
