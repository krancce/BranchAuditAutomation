standard_name: D2: Storage Boxes & Aisle Clearance

requirements_checklist:
- Stacking neatness:
  • Boxes must be stacked squarely and tightly with no loose, toppled, or haphazard piles.
- Aisle/storage-area clearance:
  • In a dedicated storage room, you only need enough space to walk safely—no need for a full “aisle” like in a retail area.
  • If boxes are pushed up against walls or shelves without blocking a sensible foot-path, consider this pass.
- Do **not** fail for boxes tucked neatly to the side or against walls in a storage room—only flag when piles are unstable or they truly obstruct normal access.
