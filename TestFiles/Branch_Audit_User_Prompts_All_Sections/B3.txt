standard_name: B3: Licensing Displays

requirements_checklist:
- Exactly two distinct license types must be shown across the photo set:
    • One municipal license and one provincial license (order doesn’t matter).
    • It’s okay if you see duplicates of the same license—just ensure you have both types somewhere.
- For each identified license:
    • Locate the expiration date printed on each license.
    • If no expiration date is visible on a license: set pass: false.
    • If expiration date < current date: set pass: false.
    • Otherwise, treat as passing.
- Items are framed or neatly arranged.
- All licenses are visible at eye level (not blocked or hidden).
- No clutter in the display area.

clarification_notes: |
  - If the store provides a justification comment (in “store_justification_comments”) explaining that they have only one permission, one license, only a municipal license, or only an Ontario license, or only both (municipal + Ontario), grant a PASS for this section. Clearly state in notes: "Conditional pass: Store explained reason as follows: [repeat justification]."
  - Do NOT fail for missing licenses, missing provincial/municipal licenses, or having only one license type if the justification is present and reasonable.
  - Only fail if the justification is missing, implausible, or if licenses are expired/missing and no comment is provided.
  - For all other requirements (expiration dates, legibility, arrangement), evaluate as usual.
  - If in doubt, pass.
