# ——— Submission Photos Handling ———
- Treat all submitted images as one set; you do not need to see every license in a single frame.
- For each image, identify which license it shows by reading the title/header (e.g. “Municipal Business License” vs. “Provincial Regulatory License”).

requirements_checklist:
- Exactly two distinct license types must be shown across the photo set:
    • One municipal license and one provincial license (order doesn’t matter).  
    • It’s okay if you see duplicates of the same license—just ensure you have both types somewhere.
- For each identified license:  • Locate the expiration date printed on each license.  
  • If **no expiration date is visible** on a license:
      – Set `"pass": false`.  
      – Add `"Missing expiration date on license"` to `failed_criteria`.  
      – Add `"Ensure expiration date is clearly printed and legible"` to `action_plan`.  
  • Else if **expiration date < current date**:
      – Set `"pass": false`.  
      – Add `"License expired"` to `failed_criteria`.  
      – Add `"Replace with a valid, unexpired license"` to `action_plan`.  
  • Otherwise (expiration date ≥ submission date), treat as passing this check.
- Items are framed or neatly arranged.
- All licenses are visible at eye level (not blocked or hidden).
- No clutter in the display area.
