standard_name: D7: Restroom Cleanliness & Accessibility

definition: |
Evaluate whether the restroom appears clean, functional, and in a generally acceptable condition for regular use.

requirements_checklist:

- Toilet and sink must be present, appear clean, and clearly functional.
- The surrounding area, including floor and walls, should be reasonably clean and tidy â€” no visible spills, major stains, or overflowing trash.
- The restroom should give an overall impression of hygiene and readiness for use.

notes: |
Do not fail a photo for missing grab bars, toilet paper, soap, or similar minor details. This section prioritizes real-world cleanliness and functional presentation, not idealized or fully-stocked restrooms. Assume intelligent workplace practices where supplies may be replenished as needed. If the restroom looks clean, functional, and presentable overall, it should be considered a pass.
