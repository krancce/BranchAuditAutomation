standard_name: D5: Cleaning Supplies & Cabinet Organization

requirements_checklist:
- At least one image must clearly show the designated cleaning supplies cabinet, with shelves visibly stocked in a reasonably organized manner.
- All cleaning supplies and related chemicals are stored inside the designated cabinet.
- Shelves may mix cleaning supplies with office items (pens, flashlights, stationery) **only if** they are grouped by level:
  • It’s fine to have non-cleaning items on one shelf and cleaning chemicals on another—no need to purge all mixed levels.  
  • Ignore individual bottle spacing or overlap as long as each shelf looks generally tidy.
- No loose items or debris inside the cabinet—everything must rest stably on a shelf or in a bin.
- No personal or unrelated clutter (e.g. snacks, decorative items) mixed in with cleaning supplies.

additional_notes:
- It is acceptable for unrelated images to appear in this section as long as at least one photo clearly shows the correct cleaning cabinet setup.
- Do not fail the submission just because some of the images are not relevant.
