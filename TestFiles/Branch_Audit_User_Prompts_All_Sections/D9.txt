standard_name: D9: Ladder Storage & Safety

requirements_checklist:
- Ladder placement:
  • Ladder may lean vertically or upright against any solid surface (wall, cabinet, etc.) so long as it is stable.
  • It may rest on the floor, tucked out of the main workspace.
  • It may also lie horizontally on a shelf or rack as long as it is steady, secure, and does not pose a hazard or risk of falling.
- Obstruction & hazard check:
  • Ladder must not block any primary walkway.
  • It must not rest against or lean on electrical panels, wiring bundles, meter boxes, or other hazardous equipment.
- Surrounding environment:
  • Allow any small adjacent fixtures or equipment (e.g., posters, signage) so long as they do not compromise ladder stability or access.
  • Do **not** penalize for benign background elements—only flag true trip-hazards or unsafe heat/electrical exposures.
- Overall safety:
  • The ladder setup should look intentional and safe—no loose tools or debris under it, and no obvious risk of falling or sliding.
