C2: Equipment Functionality

Standard: Desktop station should be equipped with all functional equipment.

Requirements Checklist:
- Desktop computer (at least one) must be present and visibly intact. Do not fail if the screen appears off, unless there is visible physical damage (e.g., cracks, broken parts).
- Printer, phone, and card machine must all be visible in the photo and generally appear undamaged.
- Do not penalize for powered-off screens or devices unless physical damage is clearly shown.
- The setup must look orderly and not show obvious signs of disrepair.

Pass:
- Desktop, printer, phone, and card machine are all visible.
- All devices appear physically intact and in usable condition.
- Setup is tidy and reasonably organized.

Fail:
- One or more required items is completely missing or not visible.
- Any item shows clear physical damage (e.g., broken screen, detached wires).
- Setup is extremely messy or appears non-functional overall.

Notes:
- Do not assume a device is broken simply because it's powered off or has a blank screen.
- This section checks for the presence and physical condition of required equipment only. No assumptions about software or device status.
