standard_name: D11: Garbage Bin Guidelines

requirements_checklist:
- Bins must be clean and empty (no overflowing garbage).
- Bins may be located anywhere in the workspace—lobby, teller area, back office, washroom, or storage—as long as they’re within reasonable reach.
- The area immediately around each bin should be free of litter, spills, or debris.
- Bins should look well-maintained (lid/liner in place, no torn bags visible).

notes:
- Location of bin is not a concern as long as it is not visibly unhygienic or hazardous.
- Blocking walkways or access is no longer considered a failing issue.
- Pass as long as the bin is reasonably clean, empty, and presentable.
