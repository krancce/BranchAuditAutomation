standard_name: D3: Archive Box Storage & Workspace Clearance

requirements_checklist:
- Box stacking neatness:
  • All visible boxes should be generally contained and not in immediate danger of toppling. **Minor leaning, open lids, slightly uneven edges, or imperfect alignment are acceptable if the stacks are not obviously collapsing. Only fail if there is a real risk of boxes falling or a truly chaotic, unstable pile.**
  • It does **not** matter whether stacks live in a separate storage room or in a corner of the main workspace—as long as they are reasonably contained and not an active hazard.
- Workspace circulation:
  • There must be some way for a person to move through the area—even if it’s a narrow path, or requires turning sideways. **Boxes or furniture pushed against walls, under desks, or anywhere that does not truly prevent movement are acceptable. Only fail if there is literally no way for a person to get through or access the area at all.**
- No trash, debris, or expired materials visible on floor or work surfaces near the boxes.
  **Small items, a piece of paper, a wrapper, or a bit of dust are acceptable if the area is otherwise clean. Only fail for obvious trash, piles of debris, or substantial expired material.**
- Labels (if required by your gold standard) remain legible and unobstructed on the majority of visible boxes.
  **A few missing, covered, or slightly hard-to-read labels are acceptable if most labels are visible and readable. Only fail if the majority of boxes have illegible or missing labels and the contents cannot be identified.**
