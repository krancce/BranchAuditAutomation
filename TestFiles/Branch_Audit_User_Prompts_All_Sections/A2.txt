standard_name: A2: Store Signage & Lighting

requirements_checklist:
- Exterior signage is fully illuminated:
  • Confirm that sign bulbs or back-lighting are actually turned on (i.e. you can see the light source glowing).  
  • Do **not** count natural daylight or bright-font-on-dark-background contrast as “illumination.”  
- All sign letters are intact (none missing or broken).  
- Sign is clean and free of dirt or stains.  
- Photo framing: the entire sign face is clearly visible and centered.
