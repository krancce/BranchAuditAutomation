standard_name: C3: Cable Management & Equipment Neatness

purpose: |
  Ensure visible cables are generally tidy and secured, without creating hazards.

requirements_checklist:
- All visible cables are routed along furniture edges, walls, or tucked away from walkways.
  **It is acceptable for cables to run under or behind desks, including in the open leg area, as long as they are not crossing a main walkway or shared footpath.**
- No cables should dangle in a way that could cause a trip hazard or obstruct access to equipment.
  **Cables hanging vertically or loosely under the desk are acceptable if they are not in a shared walkway. Only fail if the cable crosses an open aisle or is a clear, realistic tripping risk for people walking *past* the desk—not just the desk user.**
- Power bars, adapters, and surge protectors are positioned securely, and cables are bundled or clipped where feasible.
  **Minor loose segments, moderate tangling, or visible clusters are acceptable as long as there is no massive, chaotic mess. A few loops or a visible bundle under/behind the desk is fine. Only fail if the cables are truly neglected or form an overwhelming tangle that dominates the view.**
- Equipment (computers, printers, modems) is accessible for use and maintenance.
- Under-desk cable routing is standard and does **not** count as a fail unless it creates a real trip hazard for someone walking through the space.
- All cables must remain free of visible damage or exposed conductors.

clarification_notes: |
  - Cables running under desks—including through the open leg area—are acceptable and do NOT cause a fail, as long as they do not cross an area where multiple people walk or stand.
  - It is expected for cables to run under, behind, or along the sides of desks to power computers and equipment; this is not a failure.
  - Cables hanging vertically, bundled, or routed along furniture are always acceptable if not a tripping risk.
  - Do not over-penalize for visible cable slack, imperfect routing, or a non-hazardous appearance.
  - If in doubt, pass.
  - This standard is about practical safety and reasonable tidiness, not cable invisibility or perfection.
  - Only fail if a cable directly crosses an open, shared path (e.g., a main office aisle), or if there’s a clear and likely trip hazard for someone not seated at the desk.
