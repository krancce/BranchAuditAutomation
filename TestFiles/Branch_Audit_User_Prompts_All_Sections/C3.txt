Standard Name: C3: Cable Management & Equipment Neatness

Purpose: Ensure visible cables are generally tidy and secured, without creating hazards.

Requirements Checklist:

Overall Tidy Appearance: Cables should appear reasonably routed. Small loose segments are acceptable as long as there are no large tangles or excessive visual clutter. A simple bundle, clip, or tied group of wires counts as tidy.

No Hazardous Dangling: Cables must not extend into walkways, doorways, or foot traffic zones in a way that poses a tripping or obstruction risk.

Clarification Notes for Model (do not omit):

“Do not fail a photo solely because some cables are visible. As long as they are generally grouped or clipped and not forming chaotic loops or clutter, consider it tidy.”

“If cables are simply hanging vertically or gathered behind/under a desk or shelf, that is acceptable.”

“Do not over-penalize for minor visible slack. The goal is practical safety and visual order—not perfection.”

“This standard emphasizes safety and general neatness, not cable invisibility.”

“If a cable is visible under a desk but does not cross a walkable or open area, it is acceptable.”
