standard_name: C3: Cable Management & Equipment Neatness

purpose: |
  Ensure visible cables are generally tidy and secured, without creating hazards.

requirements_checklist:
- All visible cables are routed along furniture edges, walls, or tucked away from walkways.
  **It is acceptable for power bars (PowerCore), surge protectors, and all wires/cables to be on the floor under the desk, in the leg area, or behind/alongside furniture. Do not fail solely for cables, adapters, or PowerCores being under or behind a desk. Only fail if a cable or device directly crosses a main walkway or shared footpath for general staff—not just the desk user.**
- No cables should dangle in a way that could cause a trip hazard or obstruct access to equipment.
  **Cables hanging vertically or loosely under the desk are acceptable as long as they are not in a walkway shared by multiple people. Only fail if a cable crosses an open aisle or is a clear, realistic tripping risk for people walking *past* the desk—not for someone sitting at the desk.**
- Power bars, adapters, and surge protectors are positioned securely, and cables are bundled or clipped where feasible.
  **Minor loose segments, moderate tangling, or visible clusters are acceptable as long as there is no massive, chaotic mess. A few loops or a visible bundle under/behind the desk is fine. Only fail if the cables are truly neglected or form an overwhelming tangle that dominates the view.**
- Equipment (computers, printers, modems) is accessible for use and maintenance.
- Under-desk cable routing and floor-level placement of PowerCore, power bars, or wires is **always acceptable** and does NOT count as a fail unless it creates a real trip hazard for someone walking through the space (i.e., a main office aisle or general access path—not just under the desk).
- All cables must remain free of visible damage or exposed conductors.

clarification_notes: |
  - Power bars (PowerCore), surge protectors, and any wires on the floor under or behind desks are standard and should always pass unless they block a shared footpath or major walkway.
  - Do NOT fail a submission solely because any electrical device or wire is under, behind, or on the floor within the desk/leg area.
  - Cables, power bars, or adapters within the private “desk zone” (where only the desk user sits) are always acceptable, regardless of their position or orientation.
  - Only fail if a device or cable crosses an open/shared path used by others.
  - Do not over-penalize for visible cable slack, imperfect routing, or non-hazardous appearance.
  - If in doubt, pass.
